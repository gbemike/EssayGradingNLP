Analyse two possible conflicts between government aims.,"Lower unemployment vs. price stability lower unemployment means higher incomes increasing total demand creating demand-pull inflation lower unemployment means less spare capacity wage demands increase wage price spiral. Economic growth vs. price stability production increases faster than the increase in resources increase in total demand leads to higher prices rather than increased output and employment. Economic growth vs. environmental protection output increases consumption increases causing a rise in external costs example e.g. pollution, destruction of habitats.","When there is low unemployment, there will be inflation in the economy.

Analyse why workers with the same skills may be paid different wage rates,"Some workers may have stronger bargaining power because they are in trade unions/ in stronger trade unions. Some workers may be more willing to accept lower paid jobs because they e.g. regard job security to be more important. The demand for workers may be different in different countries/areas/industries the demand for labour may be different in the different industries/countries. The supply of workers may be different in different countries/areas the wage rate will tend to be higher where supply is lower. Workers may be in the public or the private sector. In some countries, the public sector is better paid. Workers may have more experience may have more responsibility. A group of workers may be discriminated example of such a group. Some workers may not be aware similarly skilled workers are being paid more and so may remain in a lower paid job.

Explain the importance of price elasticity of demand for a government.,"Knowledge of price elasticity of demand would help a government estimate how much tax revenue it may earn from indirect taxes/changes in indirect taxes may earn more on products with inelastic demand. Knowledge of price elasticity of demand may help a government to estimate how much of a subsidy to give a subsidy will have more of an impact on quantity if demand is elastic. Knowledge of price of elasticity will help a government estimate how successful it may be in reducing consumption of a product example, e.g. cigarettes more likely to be successful if demand is elastic. Knowledge of Price elasticity of demand may influence the price the government charges for the products it supplies.",Knowledge of price elasticity usually help government to formulate policies right. It helps government to decide on if it should still continue granting subsidies on a product or not. These decisions usually focus on how these policy changes can affect consumer pattern of demand generally ,3

Explain the difference between average fixed cost and average variable cost.,Average fixed cost is total fixed cost divided by output/fixed cost per unit costs that fall with output. Average variable cost is total variable cost divided by output/variable cost per unit costs that may fall or rise with output.,Average fixed cost refers to cost of production that doesn’t change with output divided by total output produced during the production process while average variable cost compares total cost that vary with levels of output with total output during the production process. Average fixed cost is Fixed cost/quantity while average variable cost is Variable cost/quantity.,3

Analyse what determines a firm’s demand for capital goods.,"The expected demand for the product produced (1) the higher the output, the more capital goods needed. Advances in technology new capital equipment is likely to be more productive. The price of the capital equipment the cheaper the price, the more capital equipment that is likely to be bought.
